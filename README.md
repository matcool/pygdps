# PyGDPS [WIP]
Geometry dash Private server written in python using Flask and MongoDB, highly based off [Cvolton/GMDprivateServer](https://github.com/Cvolton/GMDprivateServer)

## Implemented
- `/uploadGJLevel21.php` - uploading a level works, and thats it (no replacing already uploaded level, etc)
- `/getGJLevels21.php` - basic searching works (name search, id search, most liked etc) although most filters are still missing
- `/getGJMapPacks21.php` - mappacks are not yet stored in the db
- `/downloadGJLevel22.php` - daily levels dont work yet
