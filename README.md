# PyGDPS [WIP]
Geometry dash Private server written in python using Flask and MongoDB, highly based off [Cvolton/GMDprivateServer](https://github.com/Cvolton/GMDprivateServer)

## Implemented
- `/uploadGJLevel21.php` - uploading a level works, and thats it
- `/getGJLevels21.php` - **always** sends all levels in the db
